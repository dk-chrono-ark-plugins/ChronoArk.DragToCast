**Q**: Can I preview skill targets when dragging?
**A**: Yes. Skill target preview is enabled the moment you drag the skill out of its slot.

**Q**: Is it possible to cancel a drag action?
**A**: Yes, simply **right click** or release the skill on an empty spot, invalid target, or back on the skill itself. Note that releasing on empty or any target might still cast some skills.

**Q**: Can X features be added, and Y bugs fixed?
**A**: Yes, if you provide feedback.
